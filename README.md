#Game Rules
For those who don't know Blackjack (or 21) is a betting game where a group of players play against the dealer, each person is trying to 
get as close to 21 as they can without going over. The rules from there are relatively simple
The dealer deals 2 cards to every player
the player will either "hit" (draw an extra card), "stay" (finish the round), or "bust" (go over 21)
if a player's or dealer's hand is 21 on the first two cards they will immediately win (Blackjack)  if the other has not also won.
Otherwise the bet is returned.
The dealer must hit as long as his hand is under 16.
Aces are worth 1 or 10 points, whichever is most beneficial.
Face cards are all worth 10 points.
